# TMLR - Text Markup Language for Terminals

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

> A universal text markup language designed for easy terminal output formatting, inspired by HTML.

## 📋 Overview

TMLR (Text Markup Language for Terminals) is a lightweight markup language that uses backtick-based syntax for formatting terminal output. Built on C++ and NCurses, it provides a simple way to create styled terminal applications.

## 🚀 How TMLR Works

TMLR is inspired by HTML and uses backticks as delimiters:

```tmlr
``tagname attributes`tag contents ... `
```

### Example

```tmlr
``document style="color=blue;attribute= {bold,underline};"`       
Oh, this is ``    
    text color 
    `love`. // This is a comment

/* This is a multiline comment */
/* This is /* a /* nested /* multiline/*comment */*/*/*/*/
    
     






`
```

## 📜 Rules & Syntax

* **Root Tag**: The document tag is the root tag
* **Bounds**: Nothing should exist outside the bounds of the document tag
* **Delimiters**: Tags begin with two backticks (` `` `). Only whitespace is allowed between them:

```tmlr
`   `tagname attributes`tag contents ... `
```

> Note: This strict whitespace rule helps prevent errors and may be relaxed in future versions.
